# Tauri Typescript React Boilerplate
A Tauri Typescript React Boilerplate that works out of the box.

- [x] MacOS
- [x] Windows 10
- [ ] Linux (Probably works but I haven't tested)
- [ ] WSL?

## Setup
Follow the [Tauri setup docs](https://tauri.studio/docs/getting-started/intro/) in your platform to get everything set up for Tauri development, then run

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Development

```bash
$ yarn dev
```

There's an example app that shows a little bit of how you can communicate between the front end (Typescript/JS) and back end (Rust)

## Build
```bash
$ yarn build
```
Tauri will walk you through the rest.
